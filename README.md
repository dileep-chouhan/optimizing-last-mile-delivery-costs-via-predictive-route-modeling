# Optimizing Last-Mile Delivery Costs via Predictive Route Modeling

## Overview

This project aims to reduce last-mile delivery expenses by 15% within six months.  It achieves this through the development and implementation of a predictive routing model. The model leverages real-time traffic and weather data to optimize delivery routes, minimizing fuel consumption, travel time, and ultimately, overall delivery costs. The analysis incorporates data processing, statistical modeling, and visualization to identify key cost drivers and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed routing optimization strategy.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following Python libraries:

* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (or specify the relevant machine learning library used)
* Requests (if used for fetching real-time data)


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Ensure that you have the necessary data files in the appropriate location as specified within the code.  The script may require configuration based on your specific data sources and API keys (if applicable).


## Example Output

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including metrics such as predicted cost savings, route optimization efficiency, and model accuracy.  Additionally, the project generates several visualization files (e.g., `route_optimization.png`, `cost_savings_projection.png`), which illustrate the model's performance and the impact of route optimization on delivery costs. These plots will be saved in the `output` directory (create this directory if it doesn't exist).  The specific outputs may vary depending on the input data and the model's performance.
